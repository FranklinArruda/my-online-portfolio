	* In the main file (Reset the page such as margins, paddings, scroll bahaviour, box-sizing, list style, text decoration, outline)

	* In the main file create your Global variables using (:root) property for colors, fonts and spacing so you call call it while coding.

	* Use the body for set whatever you want like, font family, background, font size and line height etc.

	* Global buttons using (multi-selector class) in the main file.
