## Introduction
Driven by curiosity and a passion for continuous learning, I went on the journey of creating an online portfolio. The sole purpose of this portfolio is to showcase not only my technical skills in HTML, JavaScript, and CSS but also to highlight my critical thinking and problem-solving abilities in every project I undertake.

## Planning
In the initial stages, I sketched out a basic design on paper, later refining it using Figma. As a beginner, the portfolio consisted of essential sections such as the homepage, an about me page, a project showcase, and a contact form for communication with visitors and potential employers. 

The straightforward design turned out to be a dynamic learning experience. Every step had its challenges, making the building process not only challenging but immensely rewarding for me.

## Designing
To provide insight into the evolution of this portfolio, I'm sharing glimpses of the design processâ€”from initial sketches on paper to the refined digital version in Figma.

* **Sketches:**

At the beggining , I took it out my initial vision onto paper, sketching out the basic structure and layout. These sketches capture the raw essence of the design from my mind, reflecting the early conceptualization phase.

  </div>



* **Figma**

Leveraging the power of design tools, I transitioned from paper sketches to a digital representation using Figma. This stage allowed for a more refined and detailed exploration of the layout.

## Responsiveness

The portfolio was built with a desktop-first approach and later optimized for viewing on various mobile devices.

## Features
The contact form incorporates real-time validation using a combination of CSS and JavaScript to enhance user experience. For added security, I've integrated reCAPTCHA. Additionally, I've included a showcase of some of my recent projects, providing visitors with a view into my evolving skill set and the progression of my learning journey. Lastly, (download button) in the home page so potential employers can view what I have been up to. 

## Technologies Used
* The core components include HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, with the use of SCSS for enhanced styling.

* Visual Studio Code served as the primary development environment. 

* Version control was managed through Git, with the repository hosted on GitHub, providing a transparent view of the project's evolution.

_Very proud of myself in building this project. I am happy to be part of a such huge community of developers which whom uses the portifolio to showcase the projects developed._
