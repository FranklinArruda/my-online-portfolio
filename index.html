         <h3>Passionate Front-End Developer with a Creative Edge</h3>

         <p>Driven by curiosity and a desire for change, I made the bold decision to go on an exchange program in
            Ireland, fuelled by my desire to study abroad and reshape my career path. I found my love for coding and
            computer technology thanks to my natural creativity and strong problem-solving abilities. Throughout my
            degree, I have explored various modules and embraced self-study to expand my knowledge.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="about-content">
         <p>I embarked on my coding journey as a naive computer science student with absolutely no prior experience or
            knowledge. During my first year, I often considered giving up due to the overwhelming number of tools,
            software, and projects available out there.</p><br>

         <p>Entering my second year in the bachelorâ€™s degree program in computer science and information technology, I
            decided to take matters into my own hands and leverage my skills. As an international student studying
            abroad, staying organized was crucial to my success. So, I created a set of impressive spreadsheets that
            served a dual purpose: helping me manage my expenses and organizing my studies as well as my personal life,
            which later on gave me the brainstorm to creating this project.</p><br>
         <div class="read-more-text">
            <p>Inspired by the effectiveness of my spreadsheets, I came up with an idea to expand their utility. I
               envisioned creating personal projects based on these spreadsheets that could be shared with fellow
               international students facing similar challenges. By transforming my spreadsheets into practical tools, I
               aimed to provide valuable resources to others navigating life abroad. </p><br>

            <p>Since more than half of my classmates at college are from abroad, my goal has been to provide practical
               resources and support for international students such as guiding them on how to be more organized,
               adjusting taxes on Revenue and so forth.</p><br>

            <p>Then, the most effective way for doing it so was to explore the web development field and its features
               such as learning HTML, CSS and Java Script, which later, became my motivation. I'm truly passionate about
               creating impactful projects that benefit this community.</p><br>

            <p>
               Since then, I've pushed myself to enter the industry as a front-end developer through internships,
               showcasing my personal projects. Despite the challenges of being a beginner, and as I am a self-taught
               English student. I've always believed in the possibility of success. Now, I'm ready to embrace discomfort
               once more and pursue my goals to become a Developer.

                     I am in the process of creating a Java-based tax calculator with a singular mission: to assist
                     foreign students, including myself, in navigating the complexities of taxation. Over the years,
                     I've personally faced the burden of taxation without a clear understanding of the system. Along my
                     journey, I embarked on a pursuit of knowledge, earning a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and
                     Information Technology.

                     <br>

                     During this educational journey, I undertook various small projects as part of my college
                     coursework. In 2022, an idea was born - the concept of developing an application that could serve
                     as a guiding light for those in need of tax assistance.
                     <br>
                     <br>

                     This project fills me with excitement and
                     optimism. While there is work yet to be done, I am committed to bringing this tool to fruition.

                     It will have internal memory, so other people can download it and use it on their desktops as well as I do. The app is
                     going to be independently.

                     The reason behind is that I do not feel comfortable saving passwords online even using excel for it. So I came up with
                     the idea of developing my own app for personal purposes only, also, being able to expand and share with those who wants
                     to use it.
